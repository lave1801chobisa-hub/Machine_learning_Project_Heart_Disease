💓 Driving Precision in Healthcare: Heart Disease Prediction with Deep Learning

Excited to share my recent project using the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset!

✨ Key Highlights

✅ Accuracy: 80.88% on unseen test data

🧠 Model: 3-layer Sequential Neural Network (Keras)

🛠 Preprocessing: Handled missing values & applied Z-score normalization

📊 Insight: Clear differentiation between positive & negative cases

💡 Skills: Data cleaning, feature scaling & deploying deep learning for critical healthcare predictions

Neural networks can revolutionize early diagnostics—faster, accurate, and personalized care.
